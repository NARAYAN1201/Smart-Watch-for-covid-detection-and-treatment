Smart watch for tracking people in isolation





<----Description-->

Smart watch is basically a wearable minicomputer or a mini smartphone in the form of a wristwatch. 
This smart watch has many capabilities like GPS navigation, monitors your heart pulse rate, body temprature adn show all the information 
on your mobile app(for now used Blynk app). 
Due to Covid-19 it is being important to track the people, so that there will be a social distancing and the spreading of the virus can be  stopped.
Our proposed system serves as a solution to this problem, it keeps tracking the health status of the person who are kept in isolation for checking wether they show symptoms of corona virus or not like high temprature and sends the health status like heart rate,  body temperature to blynk app to the higher authority in every min. 
it would be an effective solution for keeping track of person in isolation.
